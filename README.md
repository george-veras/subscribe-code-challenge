# Subscribe Code Challenge

This project is meant to deliver the code challenge from Subscribe.

It's essentially a calculator done on the requirements described on the code challenge itself.

## Running the project

There are absolutely NO external runners or intallation needed to run the project other than your current browser and internet connection.
All the code dependencies were kept to a minimum respecting the challenge requirements.
So, to open the calculator app, just open the `challenge.html` file on your favorite browser OR double-click it on your computer after cloning this repo.

## Tests

Tests were provided with minimum external dependencies,
in fact the whole project counts on no more than two dependencies, and they are solely related to testing purposes:

1. [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
2. [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

There are exactly 9 tests in the current test suite, 
3 of them are required by the challenge itself and the others are bonus or just tests used during the code design.

There are NO requirements for viewing the tests other than a regular browser and internet connection.

Just double-click the `test.challenge.html` file (or open it using your browser) and all the tests will run after the dependencies are loaded.
